# Kinetra handoff — 2026-09-19

This document exists so the next coding agent can continue without reconstructing the entire development history.

## Product intent

Kinetra is an **AI-first 3D game engine built around TypeScript + Three.js**.

Three.js is the renderer/library, not the language. TypeScript is the primary implementation language.

The engine is intended to produce **complete Windows games**, not browser-only demos. The visual editor is secondary. The AI-facing structured command/query/runtime interface is primary.

## Architecture thesis

The source of truth is text/schema data. Three.js scene objects are runtime projections only.

## What is safely on main

The repository has already established the architectural foundation and several tested subsystem cores.

See `docs/STATUS.md` for the exact phase matrix.

At a high level, `main` contains:

- versioned project model + migrations;
- typed command/query bus;
- minimal Three.js runtime projection;
- dependency/license guardrails;
- standalone Windows Electron packaging spike;
- MCP/service baseline;
- deterministic Blender/GLB asset-core work;
- animation semantic core;
- complete-game contracts for script lifecycle, prefabs, input, audio, save/settings;
- verification/acceptance core;
- Linux dev-Electron smoke: `pnpm --filter @kinetra/player smoke:linux` (not Windows packaged proof).

These are foundations, not proof that the whole engine is finished.

## Important WIP branches / PRs

Treat the following only as implementation references until re-proven:

- **PR #29** — Electron runtime bridge / real frame capture.
  - useful design/reference;
  - not part of `main`;
  - requires fresh bounded Windows integration validation before merge.

- **PR #26** — Rapier + Recast integration.
  - library adapters exist;
  - CI exposed real behavior mismatches in character-controller/navmesh tests;
  - do not merge without repairing behavior, not merely weakening assertions.

- **PR #28** — release/Steam distribution contracts.
  - useful release-layout/signing/SteamPipe contract ideas;
  - real signing and Steam upload require external credentials;
  - not required for normal engine runtime.

- **PR #22** — observer editor.
  - old stacked branch based on an earlier P2 branch;
  - use as a reference for editor shape only;
  - do not merge as-is.

## Why development paused here

A long coding run created too much parallel WIP. Continuing to add more systems before consolidating would increase hidden integration errors.

The next agent should **not** continue by implementing every roadmap phase in one run.

Instead:

1. pick one phase;
2. define one acceptance gate;
3. use a fresh branch from current `main`;
4. port only the necessary ideas from WIP PRs;
5. run CI;
6. merge only when the behavioral gate passes.

## Recommended continuation order

### 1. Finish P2 — real runtime bridge

Goal: prove an agent can run the real project, query it, inject semantic input, capture a real frame and read logs.

Do this before the editor.

### 2. Rebuild/port P3 observer editor on top of accepted P2

The editor must call the same command bus as AI tools. It must not become a second hidden authoring path.

### 3. Finish P7 physics/navigation as a small vertical slice

Prove:
- one dynamic rigid body;
- one authoritative character movement path;
- one baked navmesh;
- one path query;
- deterministic cleanup.

Do not start crowds/LOD/perf extras first.

### 4. Wire P8 acceptance runner into the runtime/MCP

P8 MCP acceptance execution (`test.runAcceptance`) and packaged-runtime verification are proven against dev Electron and `KinetraGame.exe`.

### 5. Reference game (P10 Slice 1, Slice 2, Slice 3, Slice 4 Proven)

The bounded reference-game vertical slice ("Kinetra Arena") is proven on top of P2, P6, P7, and P8 against both dev Electron and packaged `KinetraGame.exe`. It verifies the autonomous loop: author -> run -> observe -> test -> fix -> package -> verify packaged build.
Slice 1 proved core movement, NavMesh chase, win/lose, audio, and save/load.
Slice 2 proved the player-facing shell: Main Menu, HUD, Pause, Settings, Gamepad snapshot provider, and Result screens.
Slice 3 proved the repeatable gameplay loop: explicit run status (`idle` -> `active` -> `completed`/`failed`), 3 structured deterministic objectives (Security Console, Power Core, Escape Goal), HUD projection with completed count, Lockdown Survival Challenge with 1.6x enemy speed boost, and multi-process save/restore preserving exact progress.
Slice 4 proved the combat foundation: deterministic player combat action (`player.attack`), cooldown and 2.0m range check, structured hit/miss events, bidirectional damage model (player damages enemy, enemy damages player, health bounded in [0, 3]), enemy defeated state halting navigation and attacks, combat audio feedback, multi-process save/restore of combat state, and full 5-scenario acceptance against packaged `KinetraGame.exe`.

## Completion definition

Kinetra is not "done" when:
- TypeScript builds;
- a Three.js scene looks nice;
- the editor opens;
- a web demo works.

The target proof is:

```text
blank project
 -> AI authors game through structured tools
 -> assets imported deterministically
 -> runtime runs
 -> semantic tests pass
 -> Windows executable is built
 -> packaged executable launches
 -> packaged acceptance suite passes
```

## Do not infer implementation status from folder names

Some package folders were created early as architecture placeholders. Always verify status in `docs/STATUS.md`, CI and the relevant package tests before assuming a subsystem exists.
